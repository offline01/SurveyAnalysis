Provide a "walk through" on various assignment methodologies.  As an example, show the class "how" to conduct various analyses expected to be used/demonstrated in the homework assignments.  It seems I'm always guessing what/how to analyze an issue and have little clue as to whether I'm right or wrong until AFTER it's graded.  Why not show me "how" up front, and then assess how well I do? the way, you're assessing my actual work (analysis) versus assessing my guess as to "how" to do the analysis?
